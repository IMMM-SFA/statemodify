    "This notebook demonstrates the reservoir storage modification function in the Upper Colorado River Basin. In this notebook, we seek to understand how changes to reservoir storage can impact user shortages. First we run a baseline simulation, which runs the StateMod simulation assuming that the current infrastructure has existed through the whole simulation period. We next extract shortages for a municipality. Recall that the list of users and their water rights can be found in the `.ddr` file (located: `data/cm2015_StateMod/StateMod/cm2015.ddr`)"

    "If we look at the `cm2015B.res` file (learn more about the [`.res`](https://opencdss.state.co.us/statemod/latest/doc-user/InputDescription/411/)file), we see that Breckenridge has an account in the Clinton Gulch Reservoir, but a quick look in the [`.opr`](https://opencdss.state.co.us/statemod/latest/doc-user/InputDescription/413/) file also indicates that Breckenridge can receive water from the Dillon reservoir. Let’s investigate what happens to these shortages when storage at these two basins decreases using the `modify_res()` function. As done in Hadjimichael et al. (2020), we sample losses using a Latin hypercube sampling of up to 20% of the capacity of the reservoirs (informed by Graf et al. (2010)) which may be due to erosion and sedimentation of reservoirs in the UCRB, resulting in reduced storage. The accounts associated with the reservoirs are also reduced equally in order to accommodate the new storage level. For this example, we want to change the reservoir storage for a specific set of reservoirs by specifying the reservoir IDs for the `target_structure_id_list`. However, by setting `target_structure_id_list=None` we can decrease storage at all reservoirs in the basin."

    "When we plot the shortages to Breckenridge under the alternative SOW where reservoir storage is reduced across the two reservoirs, we can see that there are now instances in which Breckenridge experiences larger shortages than in the baseline case. Given that the town utilizes both direct diversions and reservoir storage for water supply, this result suggests that they have less of a bank of water to pull from in the two reservoirs which increases shortages. However, there are even some cases where the town experiences surpluses and many cases where the shortages do not change, demonstrating that there is inherent complexity in the mapping of reservoir level to shortages, especially when the user has multiple reservoir accounts.
